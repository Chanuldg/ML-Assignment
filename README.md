# ML-Assignment
Python project for predicting Olympic medal winners.

## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop four predictive models using different supervised learning algorithms to determine whether an athlete will win a medal or not based on a given set of data. This predictive model can identify medal-winning athletes and provide insights to coaches and sports officials to improve training and selection processes.


## Supervised Learning Algorithms
01. Logistic Regression
02. Gradient Boosting
03. Random Forest
04. Linear Regression

## Data Used

The dataset used for this project was from 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results collected from Kaggle and consists of 271116 observations and 15 features including player name, age, gender, height, weight, country, and sport as well as year, season, city, event, and medals. The data set was preprocessed by removing any missing or null values and encoding categorical features to numerical values.

The project used feature selection techniques to select the top 10 features for the prediction model. The
data set was then split into training and test sets and the data was scaled to ensure uniformity.
